<h3>The cyber security world is progessing everyday and because of that, there are a plethra of risks involved in it.</h3>
<p>As technology continues to progress and grow, the likelihood of threats and risks grows with it. Some of the main threats I see is overbearing security. This is something that is on the come up and is being seen all over the world in places such as China. Chinas security laws online have pop in recent years despite being seen as late commers to the cyber scene. Their laws have become very heavy and strict to the point where many companies are not allowed in. This is important because it sets a president to other countries and national security to do the same, resulting in national shutdowns of tech companies and websites we, as a society use every day (for example, Facebook and Twitter in China).</p>
