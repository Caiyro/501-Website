<h3>The cyber security world is progessing everyday and because of that, there are a plethra of risks involved in it.</h3>
<p>As technology continues to progress and grow, the likelihood of threats and risks grows with it. Some of the main threats I see is overbearing security. This is something that is on the come up and is being seen all over the world in places such as China. Chinas security laws online have pop in recent years despite being seen as late commers to the cyber scene. Their laws have become very heavy and strict to the point where many companies are not allowed in. This is important because it sets a president to other countries and national security to do the same, resulting in national shutdowns of tech companies and websites we, as a society use every day (for example, Facebook and Twitter in China).</p>

  <p><b>There are countless amounts of facts speaking to how important cybersecurity is in this day and age that we believe a lot of people undermine.</b></p>
  <p><u> 1. There is a hacker attack every 39 seconds.</u></p>
  <p> A Clark School study at the University of Maryland is one of the first to quantify the near-constant rate of hacker attacks of computers with Internet access— this affects  one in three Americans every year —and the non-secure usernames and passwords we use that give attackers more chance of success.</p>
  <p><u> 2. The global average cost of a data breach is $3.9 million across SMBs</u></p>
  <p> For most businesses, this sum is crippling – not only  monetarily but in reputation. For public companies, the cost is    much greater since more is at stake, on average a data breach at a publicly-traded company would cost $116 million.</p>
  <p><u> 3. Since COVID-19, the US FBI reported a 300% increase in reported cybercrimes.</u></p>
  <p>As if a pandemic wasn’t scary enough, hackers leveraged the opportunity to attack vulnerable networks as office work moved to personal homes. As of this summer, they recorded 12,377 Covid-related scams.</p>
